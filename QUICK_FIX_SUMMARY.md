# VolSpike Backend - Critical Issue & Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Identified

**Status**: Backend is running BUT all requests are failing with 500 errors

**Evidence from Railway logs**:
```
<-- GET h
Unhandled error:
--> GET h 500 3ms
```

**Root Cause**: Your `src/index.ts` is passing Node.js `req`/`res` objects to Hono's `app.fetch()` method, which expects Web API `Request` objects. This causes an immediate crash on every request.

---

## ✅ What To Do

### Step 1: Replace src/index.ts
Copy the contents of **`index-CORRECTED.ts`** and replace your current `src/index.ts`

### Step 2: Test Locally
```bash
npm run build
npm start
# In another terminal:
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-25T...","version":"1.0.0"}
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Railway
```bash
git add src/index.ts
git commit -m "Fix: Correct Hono and Node.js server integration"
git push
```

Railway will automatically redeploy. Wait for deployment to complete.

### Step 4: Verify in Production
```bash
curl https://volspike-production.up.railway.app/health
```

Should return the same JSON response as Step 2.

## 🔑 What Changed

**Old (Broken)**:
```typescript
const server = createServer(async (req, res) => {
    const response = await app.fetch(req as any, res as any)  // ❌ Wrong API types
    return response
})
```

**New (Fixed)**:
```typescript
const server = createServer(async (req, res) => {
    try {
        // Convert Node.js Request → Web API Request
        const url = new URL(req.url || '/', `http://${req.headers.host}`)
        const request = new Request(url, {
            method: req.method,
            headers: req.headers as any,
            body: req.method !== 'GET' && req.method !== 'HEAD' ? req : undefined,
        })

        // Now app.fetch() gets the correct Web API Request
        const response = await app.fetch(request)

        // Convert Web API Response → Node.js Response
        res.writeHead(response.status, Object.fromEntries(response.headers))
        if (response.body) {
            const reader = response.body.getReader()
            // Stream the body
        }
    } catch (error) {
        // Proper error handling
    }
})
```

## 📊 Expected Results After Fix

### Before Fix
```
🚀 VolSpike Backend running on port 3001
<-- GET /health
Unhandled error: ...
--> GET /health 500 3ms
```

### After Fix
```
🚀 VolSpike Backend running on port 3001
<-- GET /health
--> GET /health 200 2ms
```

---

## ✨ Key Improvements

1. **Proper Request/Response Conversion** - Node.js ↔ Web API
2. **Better Error Handling** - Errors don't crash the response
3. **Streaming Support** - Response bodies are properly streamed
4. **Socket.IO Still Works** - All Socket.IO functionality preserved
5. **Clean Shutdown** - Graceful shutdown for both server and Socket.IO

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If it still doesn't work after deploying:

1. **Check Railway Logs**:
   ```bash
   railway logs -s volspike-production
   ```
   Look for any new errors after the port message.

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - `FRONTEND_URL` should be set to your frontend domain
   - `NODE_ENV` should be `production`
   - Database URL should be valid

3. **Check Database Connection**:
   Make sure your Prisma database URL is working and migrations have run.

4. **Try Health Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl -v https://volspike-production.up.railway.app/health
   ```
   Look for `200 OK` status code.
