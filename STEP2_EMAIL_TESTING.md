   Create or update `.env` file with SendGrid credentials:

   ```bash
   # Email Configuration (SendGrid)
   MAIL_SERVER=smtp.sendgrid.net
   MAIL_PORT=587
   MAIL_USE_TLS=True
   MAIL_USERNAME=apikey
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
   MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=noreply@yourdomain.com

   # Email Confirmation
   EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_SALT=your-random-salt-change-in-prod
   ```

   **Getting SendGrid API Key:**
   - Sign up at https://sendgrid.com (Free tier: 100 emails/day)
   - Go to Settings > API Keys > Create API Key
   - Choose "Full Access" or "Restricted Access" (with Mail Send permission)

2. **Start the Flask App**

   ```bash
   cd /Users/nikolaysitnikov/Documents/Documents_Nik_MacBook/Everyday\ Life/AI/VolumeFunding/FlashCur
   python app.py
   ```

   The app should start at `http://localhost:5000`

2. Fill in registration form:
   - Email: `test@example.com` (use a real email you can access)
   - Password: `TestPass123`
   - Confirm Password: `TestPass123`

**Database Check:**
```bash
sqlite3 instance/binance_dashboard.db
SELECT email, email_confirmed, email_confirmed_at FROM users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

---

### Test 2: Email Confirmation Link

---

### Test 3: Resend Confirmation Email

**Objective:** Verify resend button works

**Steps:**
1. Register a new user (different email)
2. Dashboard shows confirmation banner
3. Delete the confirmation email (or wait for it to expire)
4. Click "Resend Email" button in banner

**Expected Results:**

# Wait 3601+ seconds (1 hour 1 second)
result = confirm_token(token, expiration=3600)  # Should return None
```

### Test 5: Registration Without Email Configuration

**Objective:** Verify graceful fallback when SendGrid not configured

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending

**Problem:** Registration succeeds but no email received

**Solutions:**
1. Check `.env` file has correct SendGrid API key
2. Verify SendGrid account is active (not suspended)
3. Check SendGrid dashboard > Activity for delivery status
4. Check spam/junk folder in email client
5. Try different email address (some providers block SendGrid)

**Console Logs to Check:**
```bash
# Should see this in Flask console:
📧 Email sent successfully to test@example.com: Confirm Your Email - Binance Dashboard
✅ Confirmation email sent to test@example.com
```

If you see errors:
```bash
❌ Failed to send email to test@example.com: [ERROR MESSAGE]
```
This indicates SMTP connection issue. Verify SendGrid credentials.

---

### Confirmation Banner Not Showing

**Problem:** Registered user but no banner on dashboard

**Check:**
1. User is logged in (`current_user.is_authenticated` = True)
2. Database: `SELECT email_confirmed FROM users WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL';`
   - Should be `0` for unconfirmed users
3. Clear browser cache and reload dashboard

---

### Resend Button Not Working

**Problem:** Clicking "Resend Email" does nothing

**Check:**
1. Open browser DevTools > Console for errors
2. Check Network tab for `/resend-confirmation` POST request
3. Verify Flask app is running
4. Check Flask console for error logs

**Common Error:**
```
Error: 400 Bad Request - Email already confirmed!
```
Solution: User's email is already confirmed. No resend needed.

---

### Token Expired Error

**Problem:** Clicked link but got "expired" error

**Solutions:**
1. Confirmation tokens expire after 1 hour (security feature)
2. Click "Resend Email" button on dashboard to get new link
3. New token is valid for 1 more hour

---
