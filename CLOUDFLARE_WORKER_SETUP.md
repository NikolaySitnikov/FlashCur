2. Copy the URL (example: `https://volspike-binance-proxy.your-name.workers.dev`)
3. **Test it** by visiting:

## Troubleshooting

### Worker Returns 500 Error
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE `cloudflare-worker.js` code
- Check Worker logs in Cloudflare dashboard
- Verify the Worker is deployed and active

### Worker Returns 404
- Check your Railway environment variable
- Make sure URL doesn't have trailing slash
- Format: `https://worker-name.subdomain.workers.dev` (NO `/` at end)

### Still Getting 451 Errors
- Make sure Railway redeployed after adding the variable
- Check logs show the NEW Worker URL
- Try manually redeploying in Railway

## Alternative: Use My Pre-Made Worker (Quick Test)

If you want to test quickly, I can provide a temporary public worker URL.
But for production, you MUST create your own (to control rate limits).

## Questions?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Cloudflare Worker logs (in Cloudflare dashboard)
2. Check Railway logs (to see what URL it's using)
3. Test Worker URL directly in browser
4. Make sure environment variable is set correctly

Once your app is working with Cloudflare Workers:

### Optional Optimizations:
1. **Add rate limiting** to the Worker (if needed)
