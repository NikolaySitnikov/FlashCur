# FlashCur - Binance Perpetual Futures Trading Dashboard

## Executive Summary

FlashCur (accessible at VolSpike.com) is a comprehensive SaaS platform designed for cryptocurrency futures traders, with a primary focus on monitoring Binance USDT-perpetual pairs. It provides real-time insights into 24-hour trading volumes, funding rates, asset prices, and volume spike alerts. The tool auto-refreshes data, generates TradingView-compatible watchlists, and ignores delisted or inactive contracts for accuracy.

**Launched:** October 2025  
**Business Model:** Freemium with three tiers: Free, Pro ($9.99/month), and Elite ($29.99/month)  
**Target Market:** Active Binance futures traders (estimated 1-5 million globally)  
**Projected Revenue:** $432,000 annually in realistic mid-range scenario (100,000 users, 3% paid conversion)

## Problem Statement

In the cryptocurrency futures market, particularly on platforms like Binance, traders face several challenges:

- **Information Overload**: With hundreds of USDT-perpetual pairs, monitoring 24-hour volumes, funding rates, and price changes manually is time-consuming and error-prone
- **Missed Opportunities**: Volume spikes often signal market momentum (e.g., breakouts or liquidations), but without automated alerts, traders react too late
- **Data Reliability**: Delisted or inactive contracts clutter views, and free tools lack customization or real-time updates
- **Fragmented Tools**: Traders juggle multiple apps (TradingView for charts, Binance app for data, custom scripts for alerts), leading to inefficiency
- **Accessibility Barriers**: Beginners need simple interfaces, while pros require advanced features like historical analytics and integrations—few tools balance both

As of 2025, Binance's futures volume exceeds $70 billion daily, but the ecosystem lacks a dedicated, alert-focused dashboard for perpetuals. This results in lost profits, increased risk, and trader burnout.
