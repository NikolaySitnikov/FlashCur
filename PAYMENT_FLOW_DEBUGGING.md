# üö® PAYMENT FLOW DEBUGGING
## Issue: User Still on Free Tier After Stripe Payment

### ‚úÖ **What's Working:**
1. **CSS Layout**: Feature Comparison table, FAQ section, and Footer CTA are all properly styled
2. **Webhook Processing**: The webhook handler code is working correctly
3. **Database Updates**: User tier updates from Free (0) to Pro (1) when webhook processes events
4. **Checkout Flow**: Stripe checkout sessions are created successfully

### üêõ **What's Not Working:**
1. **Real Stripe Webhook Events**: The webhook is not receiving real payment completion events from Stripe
2. **User Tier Update**: User remains on Free tier after completing payment
3. **Subscription Creation**: No subscription records are created in the database

2. **Stripe CLI output** - Webhook forwarding logs

## ‚ùì **QUESTIONS FOR YOUR EXPERT:**

### **Webhook Not Receiving Events:**
1. **Why is the Stripe CLI not forwarding events to our webhook endpoint?**
   - The `stripe listen` command is running but events are not reaching our endpoint
   - Test events show "Trigger succeeded" but no webhook events in our logs

2. **Is there a network issue preventing Stripe from reaching localhost:8081?**
   - The webhook endpoint is accessible locally but might not be accessible from Stripe's servers

3. **Should we use a different approach for webhook testing?**
   - Maybe use ngrok or a public URL instead of localhost

### **Payment Flow Issues:**
1. **Why is the user tier not updating after successful Stripe payment?**
   - The webhook processing code works correctly in manual tests
   - Real payment events are not being processed

2. **Is the webhook secret correct?**
   - Current secret: `whsec_cc5a28bc7309f940084daf1665b200b129382c84b3431aeb0f342fa5bfda98f7`
   - Should this match the secret from the running `stripe listen` command?

3. **Are there any errors in the webhook processing that prevent user tier updates?**
   - The manual test shows the webhook handler works correctly
   - Real events might have different data structure

### **Database Issues:**
1. **Why are no subscription records being created?**
   - The webhook handler creates subscription records in manual tests
   - Real payment events are not being processed

2. **Is the database connection working correctly?**
   - Manual tests show database updates work
   - Real events might have connection issues

---

## üîß **TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS:**

### **Step 1: Check Webhook Connectivity**
1. **Test webhook endpoint**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/webhook/stripe -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"test": "webhook"}'`
2. **Expected**: `{"error": "Missing signature"}` (this is correct)

### **Step 2: Check Stripe CLI**
1. **Verify webhook is running**: `ps aux | grep "stripe listen"`
2. **Test webhook forwarding**: `stripe trigger customer.subscription.created`
3. **Check logs**: Look for webhook events in application logs

### **Step 3: Check Database**
1. **Check user tier**: Query user table for current tier
2. **Check subscriptions**: Query subscriptions table for records
3. **Check webhook logs**: Look for webhook processing errors

## üö® **EXPERT NEEDED:**

The payment flow logic is working correctly, but the real Stripe webhook events are not being received. This suggests a network or configuration issue with the webhook forwarding.

**Please provide these files and questions to your expert to resolve the webhook connectivity issue.**

## ‚ú® **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

- [ ] Stripe webhook events are received by our endpoint
- [ ] User tier updates from Free to Pro after payment
- [ ] Subscription records are created in database
- [ ] Upgrade banner disappears after successful payment

**The webhook processing code is correct - the issue is with webhook connectivity.** üöÄ
