# VolSpike — One Pager

**Problem**: Traders drown in noise; real moves come from structural anomalies (volume spikes, funding extremes).

**Solution**: Server‑confirmed **high‑signal alerts** with clean delivery (email/Telegram/SMS) and TradingView‑first workflow.

**Why Now**: Perp markets 24/7, abundant raw data, but alert quality/latency remains poor for retail and small teams.

**Product**: Dashboard + First‑Look panel, configurable signal rules, multi‑channel alerts, backtests v0.1, TV exports.

**Business**: SaaS $29/$99 + credits + annuals. Lean infra yields >85–90% gross margins.

**Go‑to‑Market**: Telegram channel, KOL affiliates, referral credits, 7‑day email course. Early Elite lifetime sale to fund runway.

**Roadmap**: Multi‑exchange, backtests, API, teams.

**Team**: Scrappy builder‑operator background; fast shipping culture.

**Asks**: Intros to signal researchers/KOLs; $X for 12–18 months runway (optional).
