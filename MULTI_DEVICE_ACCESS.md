- ‚úÖ Supports both old network (192.168.22.131) and new network (192.168.1.70)

### 2. **Updated Files**
- **`app.py`**: Added `192.168.1.70` to CORS origins
- **`auth.py`**: Changed hardcoded IPs to dynamic `request.host`

- **Desktop**: http://192.168.1.70:8081
- **Mobile**: http://192.168.1.70:8081
- **Localhost**: http://localhost:8081

### **Previous Network (192.168.22.131)**
- **Desktop**: http://192.168.22.131:8081
- **Mobile**: http://192.168.22.131:8081

2. **On Desktop:**
   ```bash
   cd FlashCur
   python app.py
   ```
   - App will show: `Running on http://192.168.1.70:8081`

3. **On Mobile:**

## üîß How It Works Now

### **Dynamic Email Links**
```python
# OLD (hardcoded):
base_url = f"http://192.168.22.131:8081"

# NEW (dynamic):
base_url = f"http://{request.host}"
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Works on any network automatically
- ‚úÖ No need to update code when switching WiFi
- ‚úÖ Links in emails always point to the correct IP

### **CORS Configuration**
```python
CORS(app, origins=[
    'http://localhost:3000',
    'http://localhost:8081',
    'http://192.168.22.131:3000',  # Old network
    'http://192.168.22.131:8081',
    'http://192.168.1.70:3000',    # New network
    'http://192.168.1.70:8081',
    'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
    'http://127.0.0.1:8081',
    'http://*:3000',               # Wildcard support
    'http://*:8081'
], supports_credentials=True)
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Can't Access on Mobile?**

1. **Check if both devices are on same WiFi:**
   ```bash
   # On desktop:
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   ```

2. **Check firewall settings:**
   - macOS: System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Firewall
   - Allow Python to accept incoming connections

3. **Try different IP:**
   - If `192.168.1.70` doesn't work, try the IP shown when Flask starts

### **Stripe Checkout Not Working?**

1. **Check webhook is running:**
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:8081/webhook/stripe
   ```

2. **Webhook secret in `.env`:**
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
   ```

3. **For mobile testing:**
   - Stripe Checkout works on mobile
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
